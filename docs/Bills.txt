Net Metering: A billing mechanism where the electricity imported from the grid is offset by the electricity exported to the grid. Consumers are billed only for their net usage: Imported Units - Exported Units. If exported units exceed imports, the consumer may receive a credit or payout.

Gross Metering: A billing mechanism where the electricity imported from the grid and the electricity exported to the grid are treated as separate transactions. Consumers are billed for the total imported units at the retail rate, and are separately credited for all exported units at a fixed feed-in tariff. There is no offsetting between import and export. If export earnings are less than import charges, the consumer pays the difference.

Time-of-Use (TOU) Metering: A billing mechanism where electricity usage is charged based on the time of day it is consumed. Peak, mid-peak, and off-peak hours have different rates to reflect grid demand.  Consumers are incentivized to use electricity during off-peak times to reduce their bills.
